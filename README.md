# Bessambly-Standart-AOT-Compiler
Bessambly, developed by Sahne DÃ¼nya, is the lowest-level, hardware-independent language! Bessambly is so low-level that it could be called hardware-independent Assembly! However, like high-level languages, it also has hardware independence! While not inspired by any programming language, Bessambly appears to be a hardware-independent alternative to Assembly! However, high-level languages can sometimes require hardware-dependent code! The same applies to Bessambly, and this is more likely the case! As you know, Bessambly, like Assembly, lacks a module system! Both languages require system calls to communicate with multiple files! Furthermore, the situations requiring system calls in Bessambly are the same as in Assembly! However, Assembly is hardware-dependent without system calls, while Bessambly is independent! So, it seems impractical to create software with hardware-independent Bessambly code, but there's a little-known advantage! Bessambly can directly use virtual machine calls in a low-level way! While this increases hardware independence, unfortunately, this feature isn't supported in the AOT compiler. Switching to a JIT compiler is recommended to use these virtual machine calls! Unfortunately, however, the abstraction layer for virtual machine calls isn't supported! This means most virtual machine users won't be able to use Bessambly without familiarizing themselves with the low-level, virtual machine features! Bessambly also has its own virtual machine and bytecode! But I need your support for this!
